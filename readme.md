12/10 work notes

* morning
  * started day with trouble adding docs to firestore
      * resolved by looking at Firestore docs (updated add methods in new versions of firebase/firestore)
   * started looking at MUI
      * implemented MUI buttons and grid systems, THis will be the way I format my site I think.
* afternoon
   * started researching Hooks
      * I hadn't implemented any hooks yet so while working on User Account Routing I decided to try some. worked out great!
   * working on component map
      * now my basic routing layout and user auth system is mostly in place. I should be able to focus on the unique sections of the website.

```
Name of Student: Charlie Weber

Name of Project: Community Center

Project's Purpose or Goal: Ideally allow users to sign-up for and create events at a community center. beginning with tennis courts and possibly expanding all the way to maybe a community theatre. Imagine a place like magnusson park in seattle but centrally organized.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

tennis court reservation system (pool, craft room, etc)
class sign-up
updating sign up sheets
What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

React w/ redux
MongoDB
node.js
I wanna do a MERN stack
If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

theatre show scheduling
theatre inv management
maybe a small childcare/arcade type moment
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

anime.js
matter.js
phaser.js
Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

This is a pretty loosey goosey idea by design. I'm excited to try and create a little self contained community center / gym organizer but it might end up being one website with a bunch of somewhat unrelated parts. Really i'm just inspired by areas like magnusson park and am astounded that they have so many spaces no one ever uses. I'd be curious what you have to think about it or your suggestions. I'm not super sold on this idea but all my other ideas would require me to pick up something like three.js which could be a major headache to try and learn and my ideas I have for that are already made it seems (I.E. the virtual gallery on the Art institute of chicago)



let me know what you think!

I actually think this is a pretty great idea! I think this can have a real-world application and works quite well as a capstone portfolio project as well. I can see you've put some thought into it and grabbed something from your own repertoire of "needs" if that makes sense. I see there's probably enough here for 40 hours -- though you might quickly work through your MVP (I know you!). So here are a few things I'd love for you to ponder and consider: 

What sort of user authentication or authorization is needed? 
Will you need any at all? 
Many websites use emails for appointments with no need for any sign-up. Or even just a google account or something. 
If you do, though, you may want to think about how they can interact with the website, and what permissions they have for interacting with others' schedules and appointments. 
What sort of goal are you trying to accomplish with the MERN stack? 
MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) seems like a pretty marketable attribute for you to have, and with your other work you've definitely gone outside the box! 
I think this is absolutely the right time to explore, but make sure what stack you choose makes sense for the project. 
Please go ahead and do MERN (I don't want to discourage you at all), and learn what you can! But applications necessitate the stack, not usually the other way around. :) 
If you were to get through your MVP pretty quickly (and consequently your stretch goals), what would you focus on? 
Most of your stretch goals seem great, but simultaneously they seem like quick additions to the database (since your structure will be similar in nature for the other parts)
If you go through all of this, may I suggest finishing up/topping it off with a healthy CSS/Style exploration? I've been recommending Semantic-UI for react users. :)
Otherwise, seriously, great work! This should be a fantastic project for you, and I'm really excited to see what you come up with! Let me know if you have any follow-ups! :)
