##notes:

1. created readme and repo for research

2. trying out reactfire
    this went okay, I've pushed up a small burrito project. its connected to firebase in a format the class is somewhat familiar with. I might try to add some things to see how easy it is to interact with but the demo went smoothly

    now going to watch reactfire videos on youtube
